### Step 5. Perform site settings 

There are two essential settings that needs to be performed. 
First, change the URL under docusaurus.config.js to any other random URL as shown below:

```javascript title="docusaurus.config.js"
....
module.exports = {
  title: 'Redis Developer Hub',
  tagline: 'The Home of Redis Developers',
  url: 'https://docusaurus-2.netlify.app',
  baseUrl: '/',
  onBrokenLinks: 'throw',
...
...
```

Secondly, you will need to add a Build command as shown below:
