## Getting Started

In order to use Redis with C, you need a C Redis client. 
For your first steps with C and Redis, this article will show how to use the recommended library: [hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis).



<Tabs
  defaultValue="hiredis"
  values={[
    {label: 'hiredis', value: 'hiredis'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="hiredis">

Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database.It is minimalistic because it just adds minimal support for the protocol, but at the same time it uses a high level printf-alike API in order to make it much higher level than otherwise suggested by its minimal code base and the lack of explicit bindings for every Redis command.



### Step 1. Install the pre-requisites

Version 1.0.0 marks the first stable release of Hiredis.
Follow the below steps to install the pre-requisite packages in order to compile the latest version of hiredis.

 ```bash
  brew install gcc make
 ```

Run the below command to run Redis server

 ```bash
  redis-server 
 ```


### Step 2. Install and compile hiredis 

 ```bash
  wget https://github.com/redis/hiredis/archive/master.zip
  make
  make install
 ```

### Step 3. Copy the below C code:

 ```bash
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #include <string.h>
  #include <hiredis/hiredis.h>

  int main (int argc, char **argv) {
    redisReply *reply;
    redisContext *c;

    c = redisConnect("127.0.0.1", 6381);
    if (c->err) {
        printf("error: %s\n", c->errstr);
        return 1;
    }

    /* PINGs */
    reply = redisCommand(c,"PING %s", "Hello World");
    printf("RESPONSE: %s\n", reply->str);
    freeReplyObject(reply);

    redisFree(c);
  }
 ```
### Step 4. Compile the code

 ```bash
  gcc redistest.c -o redistest -I /usr/local/include/hiredis -lhiredis
 ```

### Step 5. Test the code

 ```bash
  ./redistest
  RESPONSE: Hello World
 ```
 </TabItem>
</Tabs>

- [libredis](https://github.com/toymachine/libredis) - A C based general low-level PHP extension and client library for Redis, focusing on performance, generality and efficient parallel communication with multiple Redis servers.

- [hiredispool](https://github.com/aclisp/hiredispool) - Provides connection pooling and auto-reconnect for hiredis. It is also minimalistic and easy to do customization.
