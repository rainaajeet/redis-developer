This is a complete online course for Java/Spring developers wanting to learn how
Redis can serve as your primary database in Spring Applications and how to leverage the
power of the many Redis Modules in a traditional Spring Microservices application.

In this course, you'll learn about building REST Services with Spring and Redis.
The course is delivered in a tutorial style, in which you can follow along and
build the course’s sample application.

...And don’t worry if you get stuck during any lesson. The sample project provides
milestones in the form of Git branches that can help you pick up the project at any specific lesson.

### Prerequisites

To get the most from this course, you'll need a machine that can run the application and the Redis server, which is provided as a Docker container.
You'll also need the following installed on your machine:

* **Git**: See https://git-scm.com/
* **Java 11** or higher: I recommend SDKMAN to install Java (https://sdkman.io/)
* **Maven 3.2+**: See https://sdkman.io/sdks#maven
* **Docker**: See https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
* **Docker Compose**: See https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
* **Postman or Curl**: See https://www.postman.com/ / Curl is built-in on most platforms (for Windows see https://curl.se/windows/)
* Your favorite IDE or Code Editor (such as VSCode, Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA)

### Let's Learn Together

We're here to support your learning through a dedicated Discord channel that I'll be monitoring
along with other teaching assistants.  Join us on the Redis Discord server.
