Heroku is a popular PaaS offering that allows software developers to easily deploy their code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. By using a simple 'git push heroku' command, developers are able to deploy their application flawlessly. This platform offers support for a wide range of programming languages such as Java, Ruby, PHP, Node.js, Python, Scala, and Clojure. 

Here's a quickstart guide to deploy Ruby apps on Heroku using Redis. We will be deploying a sample Leaderboard app and will be using company valuation and stock tickers as its domain.


### Step 1. Create a Redis Enterprise Cloud Database

Create your free Redis Enterprise Cloud account by visiting [this link](https://redis.com/try-free).

:::info TIP
For a limited time, use **TIGER200** to get **$200** credits on Redis Enterprise Cloud and try all the advanced capabilities!

:tada: [Click here to sign up](https://redis.com/try-free)

[Follow this link to create a Redis Enterprise Cloud](/create/rediscloud) subscription and database as shown below:


![heroku](launch_database.png)

The database endpoint URL is unique so will be different in your case. Save it for future reference.



### Step 2. Create a Heroku account

If you are using Heroku for the first time, create your new Heroku account [through this link](https://signup.heroku.com/login).

### Step 3. Install the Heroku CLI on your system

   ```macos
    brew install heroku
   ```

### Step 4. Login to Heroku

   ```bash
    heroku login
    heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit:
    Opening browser to https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/cli/browser/XXXXXXXXXXA
    Logging in... done
    Logged in as your_email_address
   ```

### Step 5. Connect your application to Redis Enterprise Cloud

For this demonstration, we will be using a [Sample Redis Leaderboard app](https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-redis-leaderboard-demo-ruby).

#### Clone the repository

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-redis-leaderboard-demo-ruby
   ```



Run the commands below to get a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a `app.json` file.


```
heroku create
Creating app... done, ⬢ thawing-shore-07338
https://thawing-shore-07338.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/thawing-shore-07338.git
```



### Step 6. Setting up Environment Variables

Go to the Heroku dashboard, click "Settings" and set `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` under the Config Vars.
Refer to Step 1 for the correct values to use.

You now have a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a `app.json` file, which is used by Node’s dependency manager.




### Step 7. Deploy your code


```
$ git push heroku
```

Wait for few seconds and you will see the messages below:

```
remote: -----> Discovering process types
remote:        Procfile declares types     -> (none)
remote:        Default types for buildpack -> console, rake, web
remote: 
remote: -----> Compressing...
remote:        Done: 125.9M
remote: -----> Launching...

remote: 
remote: Verifying deploy... done.
To https://git.heroku.com/thawing-shore-07338.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

### Step 8. Accessing the application


Open https://thawing-shore-07338.herokuapp.com/ to access your application on the browser.
Please note that the Web URL is unique, hence it will be different in your case.

### How does it work?


####  How the data is stored:

- The AAPL's details - market cap of 2.6 triillions and USA origin - are stored in a Redis hash like this:
  ```bash
   HSET "company:AAPL" symbol "AAPL" market_cap "2600000000000" country USA
  ```

- The market capitalization for each company is also stored in a ZSET (Redis Sorted Set).

   ```bash
    ZADD  companyLeaderboard 2600000000000 company:AAPL
   ```

####  How the data is accessed:

- Top 10 companies:

  ```bash
   ZREVRANGE companyLeaderboard 0 9 WITHSCORES
  ```

- All companies:

  ```bash
   ZREVRANGE companyLeaderboard 0 -1 WITHSCORES
  ```

- Bottom 10 companies:

  ```bash
   ZRANGE companyLeaderboard 0 9 WITHSCORES
  ```

- Between rank 10 and 15:

  ```bash
   ZREVRANGE companyLeaderboard 9 14 WITHSCORES
  ```

- Show rank for AAPL, FB and TSLA:

  ```bash
   ZREVRANGE  companyLeaderBoard company:AAPL company:FB company:TSLA
  ```

- Add 1 billion to the market cap of the FB company:

  ```bash
   ZINCRBY companyLeaderBoard 1000000000 "company:FB"
  ```

- Reduce the market cap of the FB company by 1 billion:

  ```bash
   ZINCRBY companyLeaderBoard -1000000000 "company:FB"
  ```

- How many companies have a market cap between 500 billion and 1 trillion?:

  ```bash
   ZCOUNT companyLeaderBoard 500000000000 1000000000000
  ```

- How many companies have a market cap over a Trillion?:

   ```bash
    ZCOUNT companyLeaderBoard 1000000000000 +inf
   ```
