Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). It is a new way of building and deploying web apps. Heroku lets app developers spend 100% of their time on their application code, not managing servers, deployment, ongoing operations, or scaling. Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. The Heroku platform is elegant, flexible, and easy to use, offering developers the simplest path to getting their apps to market.

Some of the notable features offered by Heroku are:

- Agile deployment for Node.js, Java, Python, Ruby, Go and Scala
- Run and scale any type of app
- Flexibility to customize and support unique DevOps workflow needs
- Total visibility across your entire app
- Offers a powerful dashboard and CLI

#### Step 1. Create Redis Enterprise Cloud

Create your free Redis Enterprise Cloud account by visiting [this link](https://redis.com/try-free)

:::info TIP
For a limited time, use **TIGER200** to get **$200** credits on Redis Enterprise Cloud and try all the advanced capabilities!

:tada: [Click here to sign up](https://redis.com/try-free)

[Follow this link to create a Redis Enterprise Cloud](/create/rediscloud) subscription and database as shown below:


![heroku](launch_database.png)

The database endpoint URL is unique for all and hence might be different in your case. Save it for future reference.



### Step 2. Create a Heroku account

If you are using Heroku for the first time, create your new Heroku account [through this link](https://signup.heroku.com/login).

### Step 3. Install Heroku CLI on your system

   ```macos
    brew install heroku
   ```

### Step 4. Login to Heroku

   ```bash
    heroku login
    heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit:
    Opening browser to https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/cli/browser/XXXXXXXXXXA
    Logging in... done
    Logged in as your_email_address
   ```


### Step 5. Connect your application to Redis Enterprise Cloud

For this demonstration, we will be using a [Sample Rate Limiting application](https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-rate-limiting-demo-python).

#### Clone the repository

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-rate-limiting-demo-python
   ```

Run the commands below to get a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file.



```
$ heroku create
Creating app... done, ⬢ fast-reef-76278
https://fast-reef-76278.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/fast-reef-76278.git
```

### Step 6. Setting up Environment Variables

Go to the Heroku dashboard, click "Settings" and set REDIS_ENDPOINT_URI and REDIS_PASSWORD under the Config Vars.
Refer to Step 1 for the correct values to use.

### Step 7. Deploy your code

Heroku generates a random name (in this case fast-reef-76278) for your app, or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name.
Now deploy your code:
 


```
$ git push heroku                        
Enumerating objects: 512, done.
Counting objects: 100% (512/512), done.
Delta compression using up to 12 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (256/256), done.
Writing objects: 100% (512/512), 1.52 MiB | 660.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 512 (delta 244), reused 512 (delta 244)
