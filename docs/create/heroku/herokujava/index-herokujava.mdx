Heroku is a cloud service provider and software development platform which facilitates fast and effective building, deploying and scaling of web applications. It offers you a ready-to-use environment that allows you to deploy your code fast.

Some of the notable benefits of Heroku include:

- Users can get started with the free tier of Heroku
- Let developers concentrate on coding and not server management
- Integrates with familiar developer workflows
- Enhance the productivity of cloud app development teams
- Helps your development, QA, and business stakeholders create a unified dashboard
- Support for Modern Open Source Languages

#### Step 1. Create Redis Enterprise Cloud

Create your free Redis Enterprise Cloud account by visiting [this link](https://redis.com/try-free)

:::info TIP
For a limited time, use **TIGER200** to get **$200** credits on Redis Enterprise Cloud and try all the advanced capabilities!

[Follow this link to create a Redis Enterprise Cloud](/create/rediscloud) subscription and database as shown below:


![heroku](launch_database.png)

The database endpoint URL is unique for all and hence might be different in your case. Save it for future reference.



### Step 2. Create a Heroku account

If you are using Heroku for the first time, create your new Heroku account [through this link](https://signup.heroku.com/login)

### Step 3. Install Heroku CLI on your system

   ```macos
    brew install heroku
   ```

### Step 4. Login to Heroku

   ```bash
    heroku login
    heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit:
    Opening browser to https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/cli/browser/XXXXXXXXXXA
    Logging in... done
    Logged in as your_email_address
   ```

### Step 5. Connect your application to Redis Enterprise Cloud

For this demonstration, we will be using a [Sample Rate Limiting application](https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-rate-limiting-demo-java).

#### Clone the repository

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-rate-limiting-demo-java
   ```

```
heroku create
Creating app... done, ⬢ hidden-woodland-03996
https://hidden-woodland-03996.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/hidden-woodland-03996.git
```


### Step 6. Setting up Environment Variables

Go to Heroku dashboard, click "Settings" and set REDIS_ENDPOINT_URI and REDIS_PASSWORD under the Config Vars.
Refer to Step 1 for the correct values to use.

You now have a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file, which is used by Node’s dependency manager.



### Step 7. Deploy your code

Heroku generates a random name (in this case hidden-woodland-03996) for your app, or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name.
Now deploy your code:
 


```
$ git push heroku                        
remote:        BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 5s
remote:        12 actionable tasks: 12 executed
remote: -----> Discovering process types
remote:        Procfile declares types -> web
remote: 
remote: -----> Compressing...
remote:        Done: 298.9M
remote: -----> Launching...
remote:        Released v3
remote:        https://hidden-woodland-03996.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
remote: 
remote: Verifying deploy... done.
To https://git.heroku.com/hidden-woodland-03996.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

### Step 8. Accessing the application


Open https://hidden-woodland-03996.herokuapp.com/ to see your application
