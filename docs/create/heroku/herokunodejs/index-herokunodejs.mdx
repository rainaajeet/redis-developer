Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It is a platform for data as well as apps - providing a secure, scalable database-as-a-service with tons of developers tools like database followers, forking, dataclips and automated health checks.Heroku is widely popular as it makes the processes of deploying, configuring, scaling, tuning, and managing apps as simple and straightforward as possible, so that developers can focus on what’s most important: building great apps that delight and engage customers.


#### Step 1. Create Redis Enterprise Cloud

Create your free Redis Enterprise Cloud account by visiting [this link](https://redis.com/try-free)

:::info TIP
For a limited time, use **TIGER200** to get **$200** credits on Redis Enterprise Cloud and try all the advanced capabilities!

[Follow this link to create a Redis Enterprise Cloud](/create/rediscloud) subscription and database as shown below:


![heroku](launch_database.png)

The database endpoint URL is unique for all and hence might be different in your case. Save it for future reference.



### Step 2. Create a Heroku account

If you are using Heroku for the first time, create your new Heroku account [through this link](https://signup.heroku.com/login)

### Step 3. Install Heroku CLI on your system

   ```macos
    brew install heroku
   ```

### Step 4. Login to Heroku

   ```bash
    heroku login
    heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit:
    Opening browser to https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/cli/browser/XXXXXXXXXXA
    Logging in... done
    Logged in as your_email_address
   ```

### Step 5. Connect your application to Redis Enterprise Cloud

For this demonstration, we will be using a [Sample Rate Limiting application](https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-rate-limiting-demo-nodejs)

#### Clone the repository

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-redis-rate-limiting-demo-nodejs
   ```



Run the commands below to get a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file.


```
heroku create
Creating app... done, ⬢ rocky-lowlands-06306
https://rocky-lowlands-06306.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/rocky-lowlands-06306.git
```



### Step 6. Setting up environment variables

Go to the Heroku dashboard, click "Settings" and set `REDIS_ENDPOINT_URI` and `REDIS_PASSWORD` under the Config Vars.
Refer to Step 1 for the correct values to use.

You now have a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file, which is used by Node’s dependency manager.




### Step 7. Deploy your code


```
$ git push heroku
```

Wait for few seconds and you will see the messages below:

```
remote: -----> Launching...
remote:        Released v3
remote:        https://rocky-lowlands-06306.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
remote: 
remote: Verifying deploy... done.
To https://git.heroku.com/rocky-lowlands-06306.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main

```

### Step 8. Accessing the application


Open https://rocky-lowlands-06306.herokuapp.com/   to see your application
