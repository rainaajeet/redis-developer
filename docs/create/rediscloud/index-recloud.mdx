Redis Enterprise Cloud is a fully managed cloud service by Redis. Built for modern distributed applications, Redis Enterprise Cloud enables you to run any query, simple or complex, at sub-millisecond performance at virtually infinite scale without worrying about operational complexity or service availability. With modern probabilistic data structures and extensible data models, including Search, JSON, Graph, and Time Series, you can rely on Redis as your data-platform for all your real-time needs.

### Step 4. Install RedisInsight

RedisInsight is a visual tool that lets you do both GUI- and CLI-based interactions with your Redis database, and so much more when developing your Redis based application. It is a fully-featured pure Desktop GUI client that provides capabilities to design, develop and optimize your Redis application. It works with any cloud provider as long as you run it on a host with network access to your cloud-based Redis server. It makes it easy to discover cloud databases and configure connection details with a single click. It allows you to automatically add Redis Enterprise Software and Redis Enterprise Cloud databases.

You can install Redis Stack on your local system to get RedisInsight GUI tool up and running. Ensure that you have `brew` package installed in your Mac system.


 ```bash
  brew tap redis-stack/redis-stack
  brew install --cask redis-stack
 ```

```
  ==> Installing Cask redis-stack-redisinsight
  ==> Moving App 'RedisInsight-preview.app' to '/Applications/RedisInsight-preview.app'
  üç∫  redis-stack-redisinsight was successfully installed!
  ==> Installing Cask redis-stack
  üç∫  redis-stack was successfully installed!
 ```

Go to Applications and click "RedisInsight Preview" to bring up the Redis Desktop GUI tool.

### Step 9. Store and Manage JSON

Let's examine the query for creating a single bike. Click "Create a bike" button:

![access json keys](images/stack2.png)


It will display JSON.SET command with model, brand, price, type, specs and description details. The `bikes:1` is the name of Redis JSON key.

### Step 10. Accessing the part of stored JSON document

Click "Get specific fileds" to access a part of stored JSON document as shown in the following diagram:
